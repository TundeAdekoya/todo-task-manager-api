The aim was to design a task management app that combines a simple user interface with an easy user experience. In addition, gamification techniques were implemented to encourage users to complete task. The backend logic was created with Python and Django. First, I constructed the user and task models. In addition, I linked the models to views, and the views to URLs. Finally, I moved to the next phase of development. View API: https://todo-task-manager-api.herokuapp.com/


First, the research focused on the core functionality of a task management application to gain a thorough understanding of the project.
